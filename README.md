# Document-Scanner-using-Pytorch-DeepLabV3

This repo contains the code forked from this repo: https://github.com/veb-101/Document-Segmentation-using-Pytorch-DeepLabV3 . All credits for initial setup, model setup and model training belong to the original author. 

It was forked and adapted to allow for consecutive document scanning, and returning single pdf files.
